# Human_Resource_Dashboard_Visualization
This is a Human Resource Dashboard that shows the attrition rate and the demography of this company. 

This project involves a discovery into the Human Resource data visualisation I have been working on, which throws light on significant facts about employee attrition and demographics in the HR data being worked on.

Analyzing attrition is one of the significant areas discussed in this HR Dashboard. Employee turnover, or attrition, can have significant effects on an organization's success. We can unearth patterns in attrition trends that will assist in identifying possible issue areas and taking proactive efforts to retain prized staff by examining attrition statistics.

This dashboard shows an attrition rate of 16.12% and 237 staff out of 1470 staff, which is less than 20% of the organization's staff, which is at a moderate level for this company because some staff might have left for a progressive reason.

Furthermore, the department-by-department attrition distribution allows us to dive down into some causes of attrition, which may include personal reasons, professional advancement, or other issues.

The R&D department has the highest attrition count of 133 out of 237 staff; this needs to be looked into, and the likely causes may include improper management relationships, conflict with workplace policies, salary, etc.

In conclusion, the company can adapt the following to keep staff: competitive compensation and benefit, professional development, work-life balance, clear communication, employee involvement, and opportunities for advancement among others.
